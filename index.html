            <p>Spider-Man was a radical departure from the established conventions of the comic-book superhero: he was a
                teenage character who was not relegated to sidekick status beside an older, more-experienced hero.
                Inaddition to enhanced speed and strength, Parker also possessed a precognitive “spider sense” that
                alerted him to approaching dangers. Using his inborn scientific talents, Parker synthesized a unique
                adhesive “web fluid” and built a pair of wrist-mounted web-shooters that enabled him to shape the
                webbing into various useful forms. He also designed and sewed the web-festooned red-and-blue costume
                that quickly became Spider-Man’s most visible trademark.</p>
